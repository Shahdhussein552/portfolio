  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am Shahd Hussein. I am a professional web designer with a passion for creating clean, modern, and user-friendly websites. My journey started years ago when I first discovered how a few lines of code could bring a design to life—it felt like opening the door to a whole new world.
Since then, I’ve worked on projects that allowed me to combine creativity with functionality, from simple landing pages to full website designs. Over time, I’ve built strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flutter, which help me transform ideas into interactive digital experiences.
What sets me apart is not only my technical skills, but also my focus on understanding each client’s vision. I make sure to listen carefully, then translate that vision into a website that reflects their identity—step by step, without overwhelming them with technical details.
Today, I’m proud to say that I help brands and individuals build their online presence with websites that don’t just look good, but also deliver a smooth experience to every visitor.
